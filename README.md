# Neovim-Setup
This is my setup for Neovim which includes the Vim-plug plugin manager

**Note:** The init.vim file simply sources the other vim setup files for a more modular apporach to the config. These other files seperate the Plugins (managed by vim-plug), Themes, Vim Basic Setup, and the Specific Plugin Configurations

## Plugins
- jiangmiao -> auto-pairs
- junegunn -> fzf.vim
- sheerun -> vim-polyglot
- fatih -> vim-go

## Themes
- gruvbox-community -> gruvbox

I'm still learning the ins and outs of vim and will be adding to the plugins as I become more competent in my abilities :)
